# FarmMart

This is an undergraduate group project which is done as a fulfillment to my BSc. (Hons.) in Information Technology degree program.
Intention of this project is to build a platform for people depend on agriculture such as farmers and sellers. 

This is an Android application which allows users to publish advertisements to sell their products or services without any additional costs. 
Users also can filter and find their agricultural needs such as harvest and fertilizers. 
The user interfaces are designed in a very user friendly manner for the ease of users who do not have any knwoledge or experience in technology.

The project is developed using React Native and backend is powered by Google Firebase.
